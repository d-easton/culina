  "description": "Breakfast Quesadillas are filled with egg, cheese and your favorite meat. From there, the possibilities are endless. Make it a vegetarian version by adding sauteed red peppers, bell peppers, or onions; or add all that even if you do like meat in your breakfast quesadillas. Unlike breakfast burritos, these are MUCH easier for kids to eat. Whenever my kids attempt breakfast burritos, they always have the eggs spilling out the back, not so with these. Everything stays nice and put. Personally, I like having the little crunch from the crispy shell. It just adds a nice dimension that a breakfast burrito doesn’t provide. Hope your family loves these as much as ours does! Enjoy!",

  "description": "This broccoli pesto recipe offers up a delicious solution—broccoli florets that are whizzed right into the pesto sauce itself, adding an even more vibrant punch of emerald green to the sauce as well as a serious nutritional boost. In addition to being a great source of fiber, this dark green member of the brassica family boasts lots of vitamin C and vitamin A, as well as some iron, calcium and potassium. Blended into a classic pesto along with some of the pasta cooking water, broccoli gives this pesto sauce just a bit of creaminess and a lot more oomph.",
